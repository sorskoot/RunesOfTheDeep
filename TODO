# Things to do before the first playable version
Keep in mind:
    ☐ put the lore and story EVERYWHERE. 


Must Have:
    ☐ @critical Implement first enemies
    ☐ @critical Implement first fighting mechanics
    ☐ Add treasure chests to the treasure rooms
    ☐ Create loot tables for the treasure chests

    ✔ Redo collision objects so everythings fits nicely @done(23-06-06 22:21)
    Basic game loop:
        Teleportation:
            ✔ Basic teleportation @done(23-06-04 22:37)
            ✔ Limited teleportation to 1 block @done(23-06-07 23:29)
            # teleport to places around the room
            # max distance should be 1 tile, otherwise similar to SS13
        ✔ When entering a room you should start at the door you entered from @done(23-06-02 20:42)
            ☐ Once a room is entered all random stuff is stored in the room
                # this means the room 'knows' what template is used. 
                # Also, when a room is entered for a second time it 
                # should be the same as before.
        ☐ Reaching the end of the level        
        ✔ Snap-to-rotate @done(23-06-01 11:49)
    Design:
        ✔ Give the player a sword and a shield @done(23-06-01 13:21)
        ☐ place props in the rooms to make every room unique
        ☐ better looking indicators
        ✔ Lighting should be placed based on the map @done(23-06-01 12:51)
            # This might mean there has to be a lighting pool
        GUI Manager:
            ✔ Have GUI start hidden @done(23-07-01 09:58)
            ✔ Hide messagebox when Close is pressed @done(23-07-01 09:52)
            ✔ Show inventory when interacting with chest @done(23-07-05 22:40)
            ✔ Hide GUI when interacting again @done(23-07-05 22:56)
            ✔ Hide GUI when move away @done(23-07-06 10:51)
            ✔ Hide GUI when moving to another room @done(23-07-06 10:51)
            ☐ implement the actual inventory of the chest.
            GUI Types:
                ☐ Message box
                ☐ Inventory
                ☐ Text box to show story / lore
                ☐ Conversation when talking to NPCs

    Roomtypes:
        ✔ Make sure we can select a random room with as specific type @done(23-06-02 22:08)
        Rooms:
            ☐ Entrance 
                # this room give an introduction to the game
            ☐ Introduction rooms
                # these rooms give an introduction to the game mechanics
                # these rooms are shown at a distance < 5 rooms from the entrance
            ☐ Normal rooms
                # these rooms are the main part of the game
                # the get progressively harder
            ☐ Hard Rooms
                # the final rooms of the game, it should be clear the Shattering took it tool
            ☐ 'The Shattering'-room
                # this room is the last room of the game

Should Have:
    Design:
        ☐ Add special rooms at the end of each wrong path
            # the can have some special treasure or tell a part of the lore
    Code:
        ☐ Fully implement DI


Could Have:
    ☐ Particles
    ☐ Sound
    ☐ Music

Would Like:
    ☐ The 'pick-target' component should be more versatile.
        # the picking and checking if something can be picked should
        # be separated. This way the component should be more reusable.
    ☐ Do TDD where ever possible

    Bugs:
    ☐ There might be an issue if the player goes to the next room while the fade in/out is still going
    ☐ Snap-Rotation goes around the wrong pivot
