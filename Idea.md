# Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles

## Game Overview

Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles is a virtual reality roguelike dungeon crawler game set in a vast, procedurally generated underground dwarven stronghold composed of interconnected chambers and rooms. The players are tasked with exploring these confined spaces, fighting off hostile creatures, and uncovering ancient dwarven artifacts to upgrade their tools and weapons in order to delve deeper into the labyrinth.

## Genre

Roguelike VR Dungeon Crawler Platform: WebXR

## I. Game World & Environment 

The game takes place in an expansive dwarven cave network filled with forgotten halls, abandoned mines, and magical chambers. Each level is procedurally generated to ensure a unique experience every time a player starts a new run. As players progress through the levels, they'll encounter various biomes such as subterranean forests or lava-filled caverns.

## II. Story & Lore

Deep within the Ironforge Mountains lies an ancient dwarven stronghold, hidden for centuries from the prying eyes of outsiders. Players assume the role of a skilled and ambitious dwarf who learns about the legend of this forgotten citadel from a mysterious old tome. The tome speaks of powerful artifacts and untold riches concealed within its walls, waiting to be discovered by a worthy adventurer.

The player's character, driven by a desire for glory and fortune, ventures into the depths of the Ironforge Mountains in search of the lost stronghold. As they traverse through winding tunnels and caverns, they begin to unravel the history behind this once-great dwarven citadel. It was a marvel of engineering and craftsmanship designed to safeguard vital relics that held immense power – enough to revitalize their dying civilization aboveground.

However, long ago, this sanctuary fell prey to a devastating event known as "The Shattering." Greed and ambition led some amongst the dwarves' ranks to misuse these artifacts' powers for personal gain, resulting in cataclysmic consequences. In an instant, much of their knowledge was lost as sections of the stronghold crumbled into darkness.

Over time, hostile creatures began to creep into these now-forsaken halls – whether drawn by lingering magic or merely seeking refuge in its shadows. Goblins, trolls, undead monstrosities, and rival dwarven factions now infest these once-hallowed chambers.

As players uncover more about what transpired during "The Shattering" and delve deeper into the stronghold's corridors brimming with danger at every turn, they'll also come across whispers about an even greater secret lying dormant within its deepest recesses – one that could have grave ramifications not only for their own fate but also for the entire dwarven race.

Piecing together clues from scattered documents and surviving murals on dungeon walls while encountering disillusioned dwarves still dwelling underground adds depth to both story and lore elements. It is up to players whether they choose to use discovered artifacts responsibly or follow down the ill-fated footsteps of those who brought about "The Shattering."

## XI. Dungeon and Story
The journey through the dungeons should follow the Kishōtenketsu structure. Here's a first idea on how that might be implemented.

1. Introduction (Ki):

The entrance area for the dungeon sets the scene and introduces the player to the environment. This area can include an ancient entrance, lore-inscribed walls, or even a relic room that provides hints about the legend of this forgotten citadel. In this section, players should feel intrigued by the story and have a clear understanding of their goal: seeking powerful artifacts and untold riches hidden within.

2. Development (Shō):

As players progress through the maze-dungeon, gradually introduce more complex layouts, traps, puzzles, and enemy encounters. This section is about exploration and discovery while piecing together clues about this once-great dwarven citadel's history. Include areas with remnants of engineering marvels, workshops with abandoned tools used in crafting relics, or rooms containing murals showcasing their past glory.

3. Twist (Ten):

Introduce a turning point or twist in the maze-dungeon by revealing what led to its downfall - "The Shattering." Players could stumble upon a central chamber where they witness evidence of misuse of artifacts' powers causing destruction in certain sections. This section may also showcase new types of enemies – goblins, trolls, undead monstrosities – indicating how once-hallowed chambers now stand infested due to greed-driven catastrophe.

4. Conclusion (Ketsu):

Design the final part of the maze-dungeon with increasing challenges leading to a climactic confrontation or discovery at its deepest recesses – revealing an even greater secret tied to both player character's fate and the entire dwarven race. Integrate choices that force players to decide between using discovered artifacts responsibly or risking another "Shattering" event for personal gain.

By following these guidelines and aligning your maze-dungeon progression with Kishōtenketsu storytelling structure, we create an engaging gaming experience for players while immersing them in a rich lore-filled world throughout their journey.

### Implementation

One way of getting this to work is to keep track of the distance in 'rooms' how for we are into the dungeon and change the story accordingly. 

# Note

The first draft of this design document is created by Rosie and tweaked by hand. Since it mostly generated it probably going to change a lot while developing the game. The document is vastly extended since using a combination of AI and just I.
