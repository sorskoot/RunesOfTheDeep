# Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles

## Game Overview

Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles is a virtual reality roguelike dungeon crawler game set in a vast, procedurally generated underground dwarven stronghold composed of interconnected chambers and rooms. The players are tasked with exploring these confined spaces, fighting off hostile creatures, and uncovering ancient dwarven artifacts to upgrade their tools and weapons in order to delve deeper into the labyrinth. Designed for play within limited physical spaces, the game will employ a simple grid-based teleportation mechanic to provide an immersive experience that does not require large-scale movement from the player.

Roguelike VR Dungeon Crawler Platform: WebXR

## I. Game World & Environment 

The game takes place in an expansive dwarven cave network filled with forgotten halls, abandoned mines, and magical chambers. Each level is procedurally generated to ensure a unique experience every time a player starts a new run. As players progress through the levels, they'll encounter various biomes such as subterranean forests or lava-filled caverns.

## II. Story & Lore

Deep within the Ironforge Mountains lies an ancient dwarven stronghold, hidden for centuries from the prying eyes of outsiders. Players assume the role of a skilled and ambitious dwarf who learns about the legend of this forgotten citadel from a mysterious old tome. The tome speaks of powerful artifacts and untold riches concealed within its walls, waiting to be discovered by a worthy adventurer.

The player's character, driven by a desire for glory and fortune, ventures into the depths of the Ironforge Mountains in search of the lost stronghold. As they traverse through winding tunnels and caverns, they begin to unravel the history behind this once-great dwarven citadel. It was a marvel of engineering and craftsmanship designed to safeguard vital relics that held immense power – enough to revitalize their dying civilization aboveground.

However, long ago, this sanctuary fell prey to a devastating event known as "The Shattering." Greed and ambition led some amongst the dwarves' ranks to misuse these artifacts' powers for personal gain, resulting in cataclysmic consequences. In an instant, much of their knowledge was lost as sections of the stronghold crumbled into darkness.

Over time, hostile creatures began to creep into these now-forsaken halls – whether drawn by lingering magic or merely seeking refuge in its shadows. Goblins, trolls, undead monstrosities, and rival dwarven factions now infest these once-hallowed chambers.

As players uncover more about what transpired during "The Shattering" and delve deeper into the stronghold's corridors brimming with danger at every turn, they'll also come across whispers about an even greater secret lying dormant within its deepest recesses – one that could have grave ramifications not only for their own fate but also for the entire dwarven race.

Piecing together clues from scattered documents and surviving murals on dungeon walls while encountering disillusioned dwarves still dwelling underground adds depth to both story and lore elements. It is up to players whether they choose to use discovered artifacts responsibly or follow down the ill-fated footsteps of those who brought about "The Shattering."

## V.Visual & Audio Design

1. Visual Style: Pixel-art combined with a darker tone focusing on underground environments illuminated by torchlight or luminous flora/fauna. 
2. Audio Design: Atmospheric sound design featuring echoing footsteps/clanking armor; dynamic music adapting based on danger level; distinct sound cues for abilities/enemy encounters; 

## VI.Monetization

Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles will free to play with Zesty ads. But may include optional paid expansions featuring new storylines/dungeons/enemies/tools/weapons at later stages post-release. Probably using HeyVR coins.

## VII.Development Schedule & Milestones

Estimated development time is 8-28 weeks divided into following phases:

1. Pre-production (2-4 weeks): Concept art creation; core gameplay mechanics; designing procedural generation algorithms; testing locomotion/combat systems; lore/story development. 
2. Production (4-20 weeks): Implementing level assets/enemy AI/NPCs/puzzles/traps; balancing economy/upgrades/difficulty curve/multiplayer components if any; rigorous testing/debugging/vr sickness prevention measures; audio design/voice acting integration. 
3. Post-production (2-4 weeks): Playtesting/feedback collection/polishing/tweaking all aspects based on feedback; final QA pass/bug fixing/performance optimization/certification process/marketing campaign/preparing launch materials.

## VIII.Target Demographic

Primarily targeting VR enthusiasts aged 15+ interested in immersive dungeon crawlers exploring procedurally generated worlds filled with adventure/combat/resource management.

With this blueprint outlined above, "Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles" aims to provide an engaging virtual reality experience that keeps players immersed in its ever-changing depths while fostering intense exploration-based gameplay full of memorable moments and endless replayability potential.

## IX. Technical Implementation:

1. Level Generation - Wave Function Collapse Algorithm
To procedurally generate the interconnected chambers and rooms within the dungeon, we will employ the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm. This advanced procedural generation technique uses input patterns (e.g., pre-designed room templates, hallways, and other game elements) to create complex, coherent levels by collapsing compatible tiles in a grid-like fashion.
The WFC algorithm ensures that generated levels maintain a sense of consistency and purposeful design while still offering unique configurations with every playthrough. Designers can specify various input patterns and constraints to influence the appearance of dungeons and fine-tune difficulty progression throughout the game.

2. Game Engine - Wonderland Engine
Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles will be developed using the Wonderland Engine as its core game engine platform. The Wonderland Engine is a cutting-edge WebXR-focused engine optimized for creating highly efficient virtual reality experiences with minimal performance overhead.
Utilizing Wonderland Engine allows us to create an immersive VR experience tailored for confined spaces without sacrificing visual fidelity or gameplay complexity. Additionally, leveraging WebXR technology makes our game more accessible across different VR platforms such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Valve Index without requiring extensive adaptations for each device.

Together, these technical choices ensure that Runes of the Deep: Dwarven Cave Chronicles delivers an innovative gameplay experience in procedurally generated environments while remaining highly optimized for diverse virtual reality hardware setups within confined playing spaces.

### Note

This design is created by Rosie as a first draft and tweaked by hand. Since it mostly generated it probably going to change a lot while developing the game.
