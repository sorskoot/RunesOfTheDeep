Here's a list of default stats for swords and shields, followed by a list of special buffs from socketed gems.

Default Stats for Swords:

Attack Damage: The base damage the sword inflicts upon enemies.
Attack Speed: The speed at which the player can swing the sword.
Durability: How long the sword will last before breaking or needing repair.
Range: The reach of the sword, affecting how close the player needs to be to an enemy to land a hit.
Weight: Affects the player's movement speed when wielding the sword.
Default Stats for Shields:

Defense: The base amount of damage reduction provided by the shield.
Durability: How long the shield will last before breaking or needing repair.
Weight: Affects the player's movement speed when holding up or equipping a shield.
Block Radius: The area around the player that can be effectively blocked by using the shield.
Stamina Drain Reduction: Reduces stamina loss when successfully blocking attacks.

Special Buffs from Socketed Gems:

Elemental Damage (Fire, Ice, Lightning): Adds additional elemental damage to attacks with swords or increases resistance to specific elements while blocking with shields.
Life Steal: A percentage of damage dealt is returned as health to the player (sword) or reduced damage taken restores health (shield).
Critical Hit Chance / Multiplier Increase: Increases chances of landing critical hits and increases their damage output for swords; improves chance to block a critical hit with shields and reduces critical hit damage taken even further.
Knockback Effect Increase/Resistance: Increases knockback effect on enemies when attacking with swords; reduces knockback effect on players when blocking with shields
Armor Penetration / Armor Increase: Swords ignore a percentage of enemy armor; shields provide additional armor value that stacks on top of armor worn by players
Bleeding/Poison Damage Over Time Effects (DoT): Swords have a chance to cause bleeding/poison DoT effects on enemies; shields provide resistance against those effects
Faster Skill Cooldowns/Effects Duration Increase - Reduces cooldown times for abilities used with swords; prolongs positive status effects duration while equipped (shield)
These are just some ideas for default stats and special buffs you could include in your dungeon crawler game, but you can always mix and match or create your own unique mechanics based on your game's theme and design!
